# Email-Spam-Detection-AI
An AI-based email spam detection system using machine learning and natural language processing techniques to classify emails as spam or legitimate(ham).

## Overview  
Spam emails are a major threat to productivity and security. This project focuses on building a 
machine learning model to classify emails as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) techniques. The system helps automate email filtering and reduce unwanted 
messages. In addition to model development, an interactive web application was built using 
Streamlit to allow users to input text and receive real-time spam classification results.
This project focuses on building an AI model that detects spam emails using machine learning techniques.

## Objectives
* Classify emails as spam or non-spam
* Apply NLP techniques for text processing
* Train and evaluate a machine learning model
* **The streamlit app UI has been integrated into the code.
* ** Check it out here: https://email-spam-detection-ai-bwtnqiqkwtbw6dcakwmhmb.streamlit.app/

## N.B the code can be cloned directly to the VScode IDE.
